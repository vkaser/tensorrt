=============================
Getting Started with TensorRT
=============================

.. TODO: The following subsections depend on how we decide to package TRT. Will need to wait for that decision before completing.

Installation
------------
.. TODO: This section should describe how to install TRT and its dependencies.

For installation instructions, please refer to https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/tensorrt-install-guide/index.html

Samples
-------
.. TODO: This section should describe where the samples are located.

For information about samples, please refer to https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/tensorrt-developer-guide/index.html#python_samples_section

Installing PyCUDA
-----------------

Although not explicitly required by the TensorRT Python API, PyCUDA is used in several samples, and by the legacy API. For installation instructions, please refer to https://wiki.tiker.net/PyCuda/Installation
