Graph Surgeon
=============

:mod:`graphsurgeon` allows you to transform TensorFlow graphs. Its capabilities are broadly divided into two categories: search and manipulation. Search functions allow you to find nodes in a TensorFlow graph. Manipulation functions allow you to modify, add, or remove nodes.

.. currentmodule:: graphsurgeon

Node Creation
-------------

Allow you to create free standing TensorFlow nodes, which can be used as stand-ins for plugins.

.. autofunction:: create_node
.. autofunction:: create_plugin_node

Static Graph
------------
.. autoclass:: StaticGraph
    :members:

Dynamic Graph (Inherits from StaticGraph)
-----------------------------------------
.. autoclass:: DynamicGraph
    :members: append, collapse_namespaces, extend, forward_inputs, remove
